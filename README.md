Belly Button Biodiversity Dashboard

Overview

This project is an interactive dashboard for exploring the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset, which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels. The dataset reveals that a small subset of microbial species (known as Operational Taxonomic Units, or OTUs) were present in more than 70% of individuals, while the rest were relatively rare.

The dashboard allows users to select a test subject ID and view the associated microbial data, including a demographic summary, a bar chart of top OTUs, and a bubble chart for all OTUs in the selected sample.

Features

	•	Dropdown Menu: Users can select from a list of test subject IDs to explore specific sample data.
	•	Demographic Info Panel: Displays demographic information (e.g., ethnicity, gender, age, location) for the selected test subject.
	•	Bar Chart: Shows the top 10 OTUs for the selected subject, ordered by sample values.
	•	Bubble Chart: Displays all OTUs for the selected subject, with bubble size representing the abundance of each OTU.
